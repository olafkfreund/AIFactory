# AIFactory - Documentation

Welcome to the **AIFactory** documentation! This guides section provides comprehensive documentation for users, developers, and contributors working with our web-based AI task management platform.

## What is AIFactory?

AIFactory is a **browser-based platform** for managing AI-powered coding tasks through coordinated autonomous agents. It provides a modern web interface for:

- **Task Creation & Management** - Create and track coding tasks through an intuitive Kanban board
- **AI Agent Orchestration** - Coordinate Planner, Coder, and QA agents to implement features
- **Real-time Terminal Access** - Full PTY terminal access directly in your browser
- **Code Editing** - VS Code-like editing experience with Monaco Editor
